# In-House Project Management Tool

Due to the high cost of using pre-existing project management tools, our project manager has decided to build an in-house project management tool to manage current and future projects. 

## Features

This tool should allow multi-user facilitation and include the following features:

- **Creating and managing tasks**
- **Creating and managing a Product Backlog**
- **Creating and managing a Sprint Board**
- **Creating and managing team members of the project**

## Accessibility

The tool should be accessible over the internet. While not currently required, there are plans to support multiple projects in the future.
